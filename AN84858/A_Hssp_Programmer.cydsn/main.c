* Project Description:
* This is a sample HSSP implmentation demonstrating a PSoC 5LP programming
* PSoC 4. The project is tested using CY8CKIT-050 with PSoC 5LP chip and 
* CY8CKIT-001 with PSoC 4 processor module.
*
* Connections Required
* CY8CKIT-050 (PSoC 5LP DVK) :
*  Pin_SWDIO (P0[0])- This pin is connected to SWDIO (Debug pin) of PSoC 4 kit.
*  Pin_SWDCK (P0[1])- This pin is connected to SWDCK (Debug pin) of PSoC 4 kit.
*  Pin_XRES  (P0[2])- This pin is connected to XRES input of PSoC kit.
*  Pin_Start (P6[1])- This pin is internally connected to switch SW2.
*
* Note that the GNDs of both DVKs should be connected together and Power should
* be supplied from a single source.
*
* The hex file included in this project toggles pin P1[6] of PSoC 4 at 1Hz
* frequency and displays “PSoC Programmed” on the character LCD mounted on
* CY8CKIT-001 DVK.
* 
* Connections required on the CY8CKIT-001 with PSoC 4 Processor Module :
* 	1. Connect P1[6] to LED1
*	2. Mount character LCD on the kit
*
* Press SW2 on the PSoC 5LP DVK to start the programming operation.
* ProgramDevice() function in main.c calls all the programming steps
* sequentially to program PSoC 4.
*
* main.c checks the result of ProgramDevice() function and if it returns 
* SUCCESS, "HSSP Success" is displayed on the character LCD mounted on the
* PSoC 5LP kit. If ProgramDevice() returns failure, Step of failure, Reason
* of failure is displayed on the LCD. If the error is because of SROM, It
* displays the SROM error code.
*
* On the PSoC 4 Side, LED connected to P1[6] starts to toggle at 1 Hz
* frequency and character LCD displays the message after successful 
* programming.
*
* Note:
*  The Character LCD functions and the Pin_Start APIs in the main() function
*  are for PSoC 5LP host programmer. If you are using any other microcontroller,
*  replace the functions with the APIs supported by the host or change the macro
*  USE_LCD and USE_START_PIN to 0 to remove all LCD and Pin_Start functions.
