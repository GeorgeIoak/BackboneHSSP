* Version 1.0
*
* Description:
*  This header file contains the definitions for the programming pins on the
*  host side - SWDIO, SWDCK, XRES. The definitions include:
*
*  1.) Port number, Pin number of the programming pins 
*  2.) Registers for writing to the pins, reading from the pins, 
*      configuring the pin drive modes
*  3.) Mask values for writing to, reading from an individual pin
*  4.) Mask values for configuring the different pin drive modes
*
* Note:
*  The definitions provided here are for a PSoC 5LP host programmer.
*  Modify them as applicable for your specific host programmer.
*  These definitions are used in the file SWD_PhysicalLayer.h.
